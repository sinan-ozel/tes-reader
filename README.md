A reader for The Elder Scrolls files.

UPDATE: This is no longer in developer, use [https://github.com/sinan-ozel/elder-scrolls] instead

## Minimal Example - Print the Number of Books
```
import os
from tes_reader import ElderScrollsFileReader

game_folder = 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Skyrim Special Edition\\'

game_file_path = os.path.join(game_folder, 'Data', 'Skyrim.esm')

with ElderScrollsFileReader(game_file_path) as elder_scrolls_file:
    book_count = len(elder_scrolls_file['BOOK'])
    print(f"Skyrim.esm has {book_count} books in it.")
```

See [the GitHub page](https://github.com/sinan-ozel/tes-reader/blob/main/examples)
for more examples.

## Installation

```
pip install tes-reader
```
## Requirements
* Python 3.5+
* pip (Package manager for Python)
* Windows
* An Elder Scrolls Game - for example, Skyrim.

## Support and Future Development

Currently, I do not have any plans. I have a few example scripts that I have
used myself, I can add them from time to time. I could also containerize the
tests to make it easier to run them.

## Development and Testing

Clone from github using `git clone git@github.com:sinan-ozel/tes-reader.git`

Install the requirements for development using the command
`pip install -r requirements/dev.txt`. I personally prefer using a virtualenv
to keep modules organized.

To run the tests, you will need computer with Skyrim installed. Go into the
`tests` folder. Set the configuration in the `test.ini` file to point to the
Skyrim's executable folder (not the data folder). Finally, run the command
`py.test -v`, while inside the `tests` folder.

Alternative, if you have docker, first creta a `.env` file that looks like
the following:
```
SKYRIM_PATH=C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition
```

Then use the following command:
```
docker-compose build tes-reader-tests
docker-compose run tes-reader-tests
```
